### Generating_and_Classifying_Sentence
Part 1:  
Build and simulate a simple Markov chain model based on the movie script Coco.    
Use it to generate new sentences.  
Part 2:  
Build a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish sentences from the generated sentences above and sentences from another fake script.
* Due to the size of English words, in this simple example, use characters as features instead of words.
